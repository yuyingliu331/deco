      3D content within Wikitude can only be loaded from Wikitude 3D Format files (.wt3). This is a compressed binary format for describing 3D content which is optimized for fast loading and handling of 3D content on a mobile device. You still can use 3D models from your favorite 3D modeling tools (Autodesk速 Maya速 or Blender) but you'll need to convert them into the wt3 file format. The Wikitude 3D Encoder desktop application (Windows and Mac) encodes your 3D source file. You can download it from our website. The Encoder can handle Autodesk速 FBX速 files (.fbx) and the open standard Collada (.dae) file formats for encoding to .wt3.

      Create an AR.Model and pass the URL to the actual .wt3 file of the model. Additional options allow for scaling, rotating and positioning the model in the scene.

      A function is attached to the onLoaded trigger to receive a notification once the 3D model is fully loaded. Depending on the size of the model and where it is stored (locally or remotely) it might take some time to completely load and it is recommended to inform the user about the loading time.
